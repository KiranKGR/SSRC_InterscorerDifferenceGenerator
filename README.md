## Overview
This repository contains the matlab scripts for generating a spreadsheet providing the epoch that are discrepant between two scorers.
This requires the sleep profile or hypnogram created by two Scorers and a marker file that provides the lights off and on markers in the common recording.

## Requirements 
Matlab 2021 or above

## Example Data
The example data for the hypnograms of the two scorers and the corresponding marker file can be found in: [exampledata](https://github.com/KiranKGR/SSRC_InterscorerDifferenceGenerator/tree/3ec8351300805a2a1426fec6dda29dd9caa51f48/exampledata)
